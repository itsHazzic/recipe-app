# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Friendly Foods Recipe App

## Description

The creation of this project was motivated by the lack of easily accessible foods and recipies for people who have specific dietary requirements. We figured that it would be fantastic if there was a resource that people could use to easily and quickly look up lists of recipes that fit their own personal dietary requirements but also to be able to search for a certain food or recipe and see if they can find something that suits their needs, both dietary and in terms of their preferences.

This app solves the problem of people with dietary requirements struggling to quickly and easily find delicious recipes that fit their needs, and the app can potentially be expanded to include more types of recipes and more dietary requirement filters in the future should there be the demand for it.

In creating this project, we learnt a lot about using create-react-app, and combining this with using APIs, saving to local storage and also utilising libraries, packages and components within a react application. For example, we used Styled Components and React Router in order to apply styles with CSS syntax within Javascript and apply this to our react components, and to enable client side routing respectively. We greatly improved our skills working with react, javascript, APIs and HTML and CSS as well as our collaborative skills using GitHub.

## Installation

No installation required, however in order to run the app directly from the repo files you will need to open the terminal and npm start.

In order to filter the recipes and find recipes for a specific dietary requirement, click on one of the buttons such as "Gluten Free" and the app will show recipes that fit that particular dietary requirement.

You can then click on whichever recipe you are interested in and the app will show you the detailed recipe page with the instructions on how you create this recipe.

If you click the "ingredients" button, the app will display the ingredients that you need to make this particular recipe. The button which is active will be coloured green so you know which page you are viewing.
