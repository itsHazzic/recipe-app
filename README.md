# Friendly Foods Recipe App

## Description

The creation of this project was motivated by the lack of easily accessible foods and recipies for people who have specific dietary requirements. We figured that it would be fantastic if there was a resource that people could use to easily and quickly look up lists of recipes that fit their own personal dietary requirements but also to be able to search for a certain food or recipe and see if they can find something that suits their needs, both dietary and in terms of their preferences.

This app solves the problem of people with dietary requirements struggling to quickly and easily find delicious recipes that fit their needs, and the app can potentially be expanded to include more types of recipes and more dietary requirement filters in the future should there be the demand for it.

In creating this project, we learnt a lot about using create-react-app, and combining this with using APIs, saving to local storage and also utilising libraries, packages and components within a react application. For example, we used Styled Components and React Router in order to apply styles with CSS syntax within Javascript and apply this to our react components, and to enable client side routing respectively. We greatly improved our skills working with react, javascript, APIs and HTML and CSS as well as our collaborative skills using GitHub.

In order to filter the recipes and find recipes for a specific dietary requirement, click on one of the buttons such as "Gluten Free" and the app will show recipes that fit that particular dietary requirement.

You can then click on whichever recipe you are interested in and the app will show you the detailed recipe page with the instructions on how you create this recipe.

If you click the "ingredients" button, the app will display the ingredients that you need to make this particular recipe. The button which is active will be coloured green so you know which page you are viewing.

When you are viewing a recipe, if you click "save recipe" this will save the recipe to your favourites, which can then be viewed by clicking on "favourites" where you will be able to see the recipe that you saved as a favourite.
